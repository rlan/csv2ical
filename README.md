A CLI tool that converts a CSV file with event details into an iCalendar [ICS](https://docs.fileformat.com/email/ics/) file. The ICS file can then be imported into apps like Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple macOS Calendar and etc.

## Installation

First, install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

Then:

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/rlan/csv2ical
```

Verify installation:

```sh
uv tool list
```

```txt
csv2ical v1.0.1
- csv2ical
```

## Usage

```sh
csv2ical --help
```

```txt
Usage: csv2ical [OPTIONS] CSV_NAME ICS_NAME

  Convert a CSV file to an ICS file.

  Convert a CSV file with event details to an iCalendar ICS file, which can be
  imported into apps like Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple macOS
  Calendar and etc.

  CSV_NAME is the file name of a CSV file with event details.

  ICS_NAME is the resulting iCalendar ICS file.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.
```


Example:

[`sample.csv`](sample.csv):

```csv
"Subject","Start Date","Start Time","End Date","End Time","Description","Location"
"Harry Potter birthday","1980-07-31","00:00","1980-08-01","00:00","The Chosen One","Godric's Hollow"
"Ron Weasley birthday","1980-03-01","00:00","1980-03-02","00:00","Won-Won","Ottery St Catchpole"
"Hermione Granger birthday","1979-09-19","00:00","1979-09-20","00:00","'Mione",""
```

An all-day event starts at midnight and ends at the midnight of the next day. Although `sample.csv` contains only all-day events, e.g. birthdays, any shorter events, e.g. meetings, would also work.

The names in the CSV header row is documentation. It tells the author of the CSV file which column to write the event details. Editing that row has no effect on the output ICS file, but **do not** omit it.


Reproduce [`sample.ics`](sample.ics):

```sh
csv2ical sample.csv sample.ics
```

```sh
cat sample.ics
```
